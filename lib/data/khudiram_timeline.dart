        "On 3rd December 1889 Khudiram Bose was born in the village of Habibpur in the Midnapore district (now in West Bengal, India).This village in Bengal was known for its nationalist sentiments, and it became the birthplace of one of India’s youngest revolutionaries. His parents were Trailokyanath Bose and Lakshmipriya Devi. Khudiram, the fourth child of his parents, was named after the cultural custom 'Khud', followed to protect him after his two elder brothers died prematurely. In this tradition, a newborn was symbolically sold to the eldest sister for three handfuls of grain. This practice was believed to safeguard the child from an early death.",
