His father aimed for his children to have perfect English, choosing schools that emphasized British manners, geography, and history.

His father wanted him to master English for better opportunities under British rule, even though Bengali was spoken at home. Bose’s early education instilled in him a love for learning but left little room for Indian culture, which he absorbed from his home environment, particularly from his mother's religious practices and stories of Hindu mythology.",

Subhas Chandra Bose, despite the Nazi collaboration, was disappointed by the lack of support from Hitler. He met Hitler in late May 1942 but failed to get any meaningful commitment from him for India's freedom. Feeling disillusioned with Nazi support, Bose turned his focus to Southeast Asia where Japan was experiencing military successes. After his frustrations with Nazi Germany, Bose left Berlin for Japan in February 1943 . He boarded a German U-boat and was transferred to a Japanese submarine which  marked the beginning of his journey toward Southeast Asia.",
